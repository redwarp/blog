# Contributing

First of all, if you are reading this, thanks for your interest!
As this is a personal blog, I am not looking for contributors. I mean, I intent to write my own articles there.

But, you know, I make typos, or maybe my code is wrong. So I can't say no to some help there, if you find something that really annoys you (I might use `your` instead of `you're` once in a while.)

To keep everything civil, please open a ticket first! And then we can get to fixing things.

Thanks.
