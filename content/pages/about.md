Hey, I'm Beno√Æt, though I usually go with `redwarp` online.

Android developer by trade, I'm enjoying tinkering with code bits there and there. My latest interest is the programming language `Rust` , and I have been enjoying it quite a lot.

This blog should be pretty much free form, without a clear focus on one technology or another. I'll be aiming to share things that took me a while to understand in a simplified manner, hopping the exercise will help crystalize the knowledge in my brain.

Find me on random websites:
